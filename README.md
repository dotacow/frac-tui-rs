# Ratatui Fractal Renderer

This is a [Ratatui] app generated by the [Simple Template].

A high-performance, multithreaded TUI (Terminal User Interface) fractal explorer written in Rust using Ratatui.

It renders the Mandelbrot and Burning Ship fractals using Braille characters (⣿) to achieve 8x the resolution of standard terminal blocks.

Features

High Resolution: Uses Braille markers (2x4 dots per character) for detailed rendering.

Multithreaded: Leverages rayon to calculate points in parallel across all CPU cores.

Interactive Controls: Smooth panning and zooming with mouse support.

Dynamic Resolution: Automatically adjusts calculation density when the terminal resizes.

Aspect Ratio Correction: Maintains a 1:1 mathematical aspect ratio regardless of terminal window shape.

Multiple Fractals: Toggle between Mandelbrot and Burning Ship.

Color Palettes: Switch between Classic, Rainbow, and Magma themes.

Installation

Ensure you have Rust installed.

# Clone the repository (if applicable)
# git clone ...

# Run in release mode (Crucial for performance!)
cargo run --release


Note: Debug builds will be significantly slower due to the heavy mathematical calculations required for fractal generation.

Technical Details

Rendering Strategy

The application uses the Ratatui Canvas widget. To avoid the slowness of calculating points that aren't visible, the renderer calculates the exact density required based on the terminal's physical size:

Width Density: Terminal Width * 2

Height Density: Terminal Height * 4

Parallelization

Using rayon, the render loop is split into parallel iterators. Each thread calculates a subset of the coordinate grid and collects points into thread-local vectors. These vectors are then reduced (merged) into a final batch of points to be drawn by the main thread, avoiding expensive mutex locks during the hot loop.

Coordinate System

Terminal characters are rectangular (roughly 1:2 width-to-height ratio). To prevent the fractal from looking stretched, the application calculates a mathematical aspect ratio based on the viewport size and adjusts the coordinate bounds accordingly.
